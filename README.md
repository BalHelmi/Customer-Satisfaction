# Predicting how a customer will feel about a product before they even ordered it

**Problem statement :**

Our objective involves predicting the review score for a forthcoming order or purchase using either the historical data of a specific customer or overall data. To achieve this, we will utilize the [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), which encompasses details about 100,000 orders spanning from 2016 to 2018, encompassing various marketplaces in Brazil. This dataset offers a comprehensive perspective, including aspects such as order status, pricing, payment, shipping performance, customer location, product attributes, and even customer reviews. The main goal is to forecast the level of customer satisfaction for a given order by leveraging factors like order status, price, payment, and more.
